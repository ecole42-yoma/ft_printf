# ft_printf
### <i> Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough</i>

* The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. 
* You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. 
* How cool is that?? It is actually pretty cool :)
* You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. 
* Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.
